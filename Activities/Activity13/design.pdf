How would you break down your program into classes?
Create a class diagram showing the classes and their
attributes as well as methods. Clearly differentiate between
static/instance methods/attributes (if any)


I would break it down into classes by having a main TicTac board class, 
then a bunch of methods describing the user's turn and computers's turn.
EX: (pseudocode)

class Board:
    var board = [[-1,-1,-1], [-1,-1,-1], [-1,-1,-1]]

    def usersTurn(x, y):
        board[x][y] = 1
    
    def computersTurn:
        x = rand(0,2)
        y = rand(0,2)
        while board[x][y] != -1:
            x = rand(0,2)
            y = rand(0,2)
        board[x][y] = 0

    def checkWinner:
        for row in board:
            if row = [0,0,0]:
                computer win 
            elif row = [1,1,1]:
                user win 
        for col in board:
            if col = [0,0,0]:
                computer win 
            elif col = [1,1,1]:
                user win 
        for diag in board:
            if diag = [0,0,0]:
                computer win 
            elif diag = [1,1,1]:
                user win
