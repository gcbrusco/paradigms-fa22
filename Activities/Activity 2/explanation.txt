The first log statement will print "JCSS" because or statements read from left to right.
Because it is an "or" statment, when the program reads there is a non-false value, it will automatically make the statement true.
Therefore, "JCSS" was printed before "Anonymous".

It is a similar case for the second statement.
If the program is reading an "and" statement, it will automatically make the statement false if the first value is false, and won't read the rest of it.
Therefore, "Anonymous" was printed because it was the second to be read and the first "JCSS" was also true.
If "Anonymous" were false, "JCSS" would've been printed.
