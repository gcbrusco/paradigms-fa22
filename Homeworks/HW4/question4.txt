An array comprehension is a simple way to create a new array, similar to the "map" function.
These comprehensions are simple implementations of loop functions and can return the array as a function
or as a variable.

One example of an array comprehension is:
Say you have an array of length 5 called "z" and want to create a new array "g" that is 10x each element.
An array comprehension can complete this task pretty simply: 

z = [1..5] # z = [1,2,3,4,5]
g = (x*10 for x in z) # Array comprehension: g = [10,20,30,40,50]
