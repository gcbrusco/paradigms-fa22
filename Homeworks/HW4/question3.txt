The program first creates a new Point, and calls the print1() method,
which prints out "print1 = (1,2)", then calls innerFn() to print
"inner in print1 = (1,2)". Then it goes to the print2() method prints
"print2 = (1,2)" and redeclares innerFn and attempts to print out, but fails
because there is a TypeError for the redeclaration fo innerFn. 
This happens because the lexical environment of the first innerFn declaration
is different than the second declaration, which tries to access the x and y
variables but can't find them and fail.
