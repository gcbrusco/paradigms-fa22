a) The conditions of the for loop is "i < nums.length - 1" where it will always complete one less
iterations than the length of the number array, meaning it will not process all of the numbers.

b) To fix this bug, change the "i < nums.length - 1" to "i < nums.length" instead or  to "i <- nums.length - 1"
