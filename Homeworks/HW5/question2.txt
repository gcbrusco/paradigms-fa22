It is good to have the JS linked before the </body> because the web browser usually executes and parses
scripts on spot, so it would help render the page faster by putting it on the bottom.
CSS, on the other hand, is usually put between the <head> tags, so the page is rendered using the CSS
linked and it loads to be all formatted.

Therefore, with a slow internet connection, the JS might not load immediately after the HTML is rendered, but
the CSS formatting will, which will make sure the correct format is shown rather than the raw HTML.
